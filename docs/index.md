Hi, welcome to my personal webiste! I'm still building this out, so please excuse the lameness.

I am currently building out [projitect][projitect-site]{:target="_blank"}, a dyanmic project scaffolding tool.

On my blog, [Generalish][generalish-site]{:target="_blank"}, I write short, lighthearted, and hopefully thoughtful posts whenever an idea or topic inspires me. Generally about math, tech, and musings about life.

Check out my [resume](./resume.md).

I (in)famously don't use social media, but feel free to follow me (links in the footer) in case I ever start!
