Hi, welcome to my personal webiste!

On my blog I write short, lighthearted, and hopefully thoughtful posts whenever an idea or topic inspires me. Generally about math, tech, musings about life and relationships.

I am currently building out [projitect][projitect-site]{:target="_blank"}, a dyanmic project scaffolding tool.

I (in)famously don't use social media, but feel free to follow me (links in the footer) in case I ever start!
